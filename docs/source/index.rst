pyfluka Documentation
====================

With this package you can load FLUKA geometry view it in VTK and convert it to GDML (Geant4's own XML geometry language).  You can also do all this for a subset of the geometry's regions as well as for individual subzones thereof.

Many features are yet to be implemented or are missing.
