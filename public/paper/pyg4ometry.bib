Such needs require the code to be consistently reliable over the entire energy range (from MeV to TeV) for all projectiles (full suite of elementary particles and heavy ions). Outside CERN, among various applications worldwide, FLUKA serves as a core tool for the HIT and CNAO hadron-therapy facilities in Europe. Therefore, medical applications further impose stringent requirements in terms of reliability and predictive power, which demands constant refinement of sophisticated nuclear models and continuous code improvement. Some of the latest developments implemented in FLUKA are presented in this paper, with particular emphasis on issues and concerns pertaining to CERN and medical applications."

It uses a suite of standard high energy physics codes (Geant4, ROOT and CLHEP) to create a computational model of a particle accelerator that combines accurate accelerator tracking routines with all of the physics processes of particles in Geant4. This unique combination permits radiation and detector background simulations in accelerators where both accurate tracking of all particles is required over long range or over many revolutions of a circular machine, as well as interaction with the material of the accelerator.

abstract = "Detailed radiation analysis of instruments flown in space is critical to ensure mission safety, often requiring the use of state-of-the-art particle transport simulation tools. Geant4 is one of the most powerful toolkits to simulate the interaction and the passage of particles through matter, but it is not prepared to receive Standard for The Exchange of Product data (STEP) files, the most versatile Computer-Aided Design (CAD) format, as input, requiring previous conversion to other CAD formats. This may lead to loss of detail and under or overestimation of the quantities under study, especially when the instruments have complex shapes, and/or a large number of volumes. Though several solutions have been proposed to import complex geometries from STEP files into Geant4, so far, only commercial options are available. In this paper we present a new tool, GUIMesh, that embeds FreeCAD libraries, an open-source CAD editor, to tessellate volumes, and convert them to Geometry Description Markup Language (GDML), a Geant4 readable format, in a straightforward way. Several degrees of freedom are given to the user regarding mesh precision and choice of material. Different geometries were tested for material definition, geometry and navigation errors, and the method used was successfully validated.
Program Summary
Program Title: GUIMesh Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/c3c9xbspzp.1 Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License 3 (GPLv3) Programming language: Python Nature of problem: No open-source software allows to import STEP geometries intro Geant4, one of the most powerful toolkits to simulate radiation interaction with matter. Since CAD software is extensively used in the design of particle and radiation detection instruments, it is highly desirable for physicists that STEP geometries can be imported to Geant4 with little effort instead of having to code structures made of a very large number of solid volumes which are difficult to accurately reproduce with Geant4 C++ classes. Solution method: STEP geometries are converted to tessellated volumes (with some margin of error) using FreeCAD libraries. A Python script then writes GDML files based on the results allowing users to import these geometries with Geant4. A graphical user interface provides several options to the user, including material assignment and mesh precision setting for each volume."

By employing a number of acceleration techniques, the ray-tracing operations that are fundamental to Monte Carlo radiation transport are implemented efficiently for direct use on the CAD-based solid model, eliminating the need to translate to the native Monte Carlo input language. By forming hierarchical trees of oriented bounding boxes, one for each facet that results from a high-fidelity tessellation of the model, the ray-tracing performance is adequate to permit detailed analysis of large complex systems. In addition to the reduction in human effort and improvement in quality assurance that is found in the translation approaches, the DAGMC approach also permits the analysis of geometries with higher order surfaces that cannot be represented by many native Monte Carlo radiation transport tools. The paper describes the various acceleration techniques and demonstrates the resulting capability in a real fusion neutronics analysis."

abstract = {Programmers run into parsing problems all the time. Whether it's a data format like JSON, a network protocol like SMTP, a server configuration file for Apache, a PostScript/PDF file, or a simple spreadsheet macro language--ANTLR v4 and this book will demystify the process. ANTLR v4 has been rewritten from scratch to make it easier than ever to build parsers and the language applications built on top. This completely rewritten new edition of the bestselling Definitive ANTLR Reference shows you how to take advantage of these new features. Build your own languages with ANTLR v4, using ANTLR's new advanced parsing technology. In this book, you'll learn how ANTLR automatically builds a data structure representing the input (parse tree) and generates code that can walk the tree (visitor). You can use that combination to implement data readers, language interpreters, and translators. You'll start by learning how to identify grammar patterns in language reference manuals and then slowly start building increasingly complex grammars. Next, you'll build applications based upon those grammars by walking the automatically generated parse trees. Then you'll tackle some nasty language problems by parsing files containing more than one language (such as XML, Java, and Javadoc). You'll also see how to take absolute control over parsing by embedding Java actions into the grammar. You'll learn directly from well-known parsing expert Terence Parr, the ANTLR creator and project lead. You'll master ANTLR grammar construction and learn how to build language tools using the built-in parse tree visitor mechanism. The book teaches using real-world examples and shows you how to use ANTLR to build such things as a data file reader, a JSON to XML translator, an R parser, and a Java class-interface extractor. This book is your ticket to becoming a parsing guru!What You Need: ANTLR 4.0 and above. Java development tools. Ant build system optional (needed for building ANTLR from source)}

The source code of TetGen is freely available.This article presents the essential algorithms and techniques used to develop TetGen. The intended audience are researchers or developers in mesh generation or other related areas. It describes the key software components of TetGen, including an efficient tetrahedral mesh data structure, a set of enhanced local mesh operations (combination of flips and edge removal), and filtered exact geometric predicates. The essential algorithms include incremental Delaunay algorithms for inserting vertices, constrained Delaunay algorithms for inserting constraints (edges and triangles), a new edge recovery algorithm for recovering constraints, and a new constrained Delaunay refinement algorithm for adaptive quality tetrahedral mesh generation. Experimental examples as well as comparisons with other softwares are presented.},
